# Development

Use `grunt serve` for development and reload on JS changes and injection for style.

## JavaScript

## SCSS/Style

Avoid modifying files outside of `scss/custom/`. Sass-linting throws only warnings. If you don't intend to get changes upstream, you can ignore them \(can be disabled for a file\).
